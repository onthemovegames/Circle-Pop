# Circle-Pop
A simple game template, built with Corona SDK, that features object creation and popping. I wrote a tutorial at http://gamebuildingtools.com/corona-sdk/building-circle-pop-with-corona-sdk-part-1-of-2 that will walk you through on how to create this game.

If you'd like to jump straight into the code, you can grab it from this repo or at http://gamebuildingtools.com/product/circle-pop-for-corona-sdk.
